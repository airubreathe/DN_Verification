# Decentralized News Verification System

This Clarity smart contract implements a decentralized, community-driven news verification platform. Verifiers earn and spend reputation tokens to assess the truthfulness of news articles, with mechanisms for dispute, consensus, and reward.

## Features

* **Reputation System**: Reputation is tokenized and required for verifying articles.
* **News Submission**: Anyone can submit an article with metadata and content hash.
* **Verifier Registration**: Users register to gain verifier status and initial reputation tokens.
* **Community Verification**: Registered verifiers assess articles, submit verdicts, and provide evidence.
* **Final Verdict**: Consensus is reached after a threshold of verifications (â‰¥5), marking the article as verified.
* **Challenges**: High-reputation users can challenge finalized articles with evidence.
* **Reward System**: Accurate verifiers can be rewarded with additional tokens by the contract owner.
